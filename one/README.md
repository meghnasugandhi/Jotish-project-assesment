To finalize your ReactJS assignment, you should organize your project into a structured hierarchy where src/pages contains your four main screens—Login, List, Details, and Photo Result—and src/components houses your Recharts logic. The application uses React Bootstrap for a professional UI, featuring a secure login (testuser/Test123), a dynamic data table on the List page that integrates with the provided REST API, and a dedicated Graph page to showcase salary analytics for the first ten employees. For the camera functionality, react-webcam is implemented on the Details page to capture an identity photo, which is then passed via state to the Photo Result page. To ensure the app remains functional for your recording even if the API experiences CORS issues, a robust service layer in api.js includes a dummy data fallback. This setup demonstrates technical proficiency in state management, routing with React Router v6, and hardware API integration while maintaining a clean, responsive design.
